/ description /  

This is a prototype for a wearable garments the translates wave movements into a 
dislocated, felt experience. This is a system that wirelessly sends acceleration 
data from a weather buoy to a wearable array of 6 vibrotactile motors. This setup 
used two Arduinos, connected to Xbees for wireless data transfer. 
                
The first Arduino was connected to a 3-axis accelerometer (LIS331), an Xbee and powered 
by solar (a Medium 2W 6V solar panel connected to a DC solar lithium charger, and 
a 3.7v 2500mAh Li-Po Battery). These items were housed inside a weather box
that served as a makeshift buoy, which was anchored roughly 15 metres offshore.
                
The second Arduino was connected to an Xbee, an array of transistors and 6 vibrating
mini motor discs that were glued to stretchable nylon straps that could be placed on
different parts of the body.
